*** Error logs are in the bin/ directory. 
*** Below is how an error log would look like so you can get the idea of the format, what it means and what you could do.

===
ERROR MESSAGE:
Brief message of the error itself. If it's not enough check the Inner Exception.
===

===
INNER EXCEPTION:
hopefully this will be enough for you to find out the error and fix it.

There will be some random jargon around here, if you still can't figure out what's gone wrong copy paste this part to chatgpt and hope for the best.
